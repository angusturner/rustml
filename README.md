# Rust Machine Learning

Some basic ML algorithms implemented in Rust, primarily as solutions to Andrew Ng's ML course on Coursera.

## Logistic Regression
Binary classification with a log-likelihood cost function, and batch gradient descent.
Usage - `cargo run ex2data1.txt <iters> <learning rate>` 
e.g (150,000 iters and alpha=0.00001)
